# Dad's Diaper Table

This is the code for a website that shows the spots myself, my friends, and other cool people have found that have changing stations in their men's restrooms. Built on [Sheetsee.js](https://github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js), Google Docs, and GitHub Pages.

# The Problem

I didn't realize this until my friends started having kids (I'm not a dad), but it's common for public places to only provide a changing table in the women's room. If you're a single dad, or just a dad who wants to change a diaper, you're out of luck. According to articles [here](http://www.mommyish.com/2011/05/18/changing-tables-in-womens-restrooms-how-are-dads-supposed-to-co-parent/), [here](http://blogs.babycenter.com/life_and_home/mens-rooms-why-no-baby-changing-stations/), [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/fashion/sundaystyles/25DIAPERS.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0), and many other places, it's a chronic problem.

# Thank Yous

Jessica Lord (@jlord on the GitHubs) did all of the heavy lifting in this one. She not only wrote [Sheetsee.js](https://github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js), but she wrote the demo [application](http://jlord.github.io/hack-spots/) that I borrowed. The design, functionality, and wizardry are her work.

Sara Pyle (@sarapyle on the GitHubs) was the friend who first pointed this problem (among many other similar dillemas) out to me.
